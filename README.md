# DOG_OR_CAT_CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either dogs or cats using supervised learning. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of dog and cat images, processed and augmented using Keras' ImageDataGenerator, and built using TensorFlow/Keras.
